# Auditorium — Keyboard Shortcuts

This table is transcribed directly from `src/services/shortcuts.ts`
(`SHORTCUT_TABLE`), which is the single source of truth the app's global
key-handler reads from. Keep the two in sync: if you add or change a row here,
change `SHORTCUT_TABLE` to match (or vice versa).

Shortcuts are ignored while focus is inside a text input, textarea, select, or
a `contenteditable` element, so they never hijack normal typing (e.g. renaming
a track or a marker).

A bare letter also never fires while **Meta** is held — a modifier this
table does not model — and an auto-repeat keydown for a bare letter (the
shape a Ctrl combo's own key repeats into if Ctrl is released a frame early)
is dropped too, so releasing a held combo early can never run a different,
unintended command.

They are also suspended while a **modal dialog** is open (New File, Export,
Convert, Record) — that surface resolves the document it acts on at the
moment you confirm, so a `Ctrl+O` behind one would land the result on a file
you had just replaced.

**A running pipeline pass or effect Apply does *not* suspend the keyboard.**
Only *starting* another one does. While a pass runs — in the open module card
or backgrounded behind a different module — every other key keeps working
exactly as when nothing is running: `Space`, Undo/Redo, Delete, Split, and
every other bare letter act on whatever document or clip they always did, and
the mouse is untouched throughout (see *Pipeline: one pass at a time* in the
User Guide). What *is* refused, with a reason naming the running pass, is
starting a second pass — every other effect/pipeline row — plus `Ctrl+O`
(Open), `Ctrl+N` (New) and Open Project, none of which may replace a document
a pass depends on. `Ctrl+W` (Close) is narrower: it refuses only while a
pipeline tool, mixdown, export or save is running, not while an **effect
Apply** is — closing the document mid-Apply is safe and discards the edit
cleanly instead (see the User Guide).

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Space` | Play / Pause |
| `Ctrl+Z` | Undo |
| `U` | Undo — the same view-routed command as `Ctrl+Z` |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Z` | Redo |
| `Ctrl+Y` | Redo |
| `R` | Redo — the same view-routed command as `Ctrl+Y` |
| `Ctrl+K` | Split at Cursor — a marker at the cursor, or at both edges of the selection |
| `C` | Split at Cursor — the same view-routed command as `Ctrl+K` (the scissors, not Copy) |
| `J` | Join Clips — multitrack only: joins the selected clips on a track into one, silence in the gaps |
| `Ctrl+X` | Cut the selection (or the cursor's segment) to the clipboard, leaving the span silent at the same length |
| `Ctrl+C` | Copy — the selection in the editor; the selected **clip(s)** in multitrack |
| `Ctrl+V` | Paste — at the cursor in the editor; to the right of the bar, on the **current track**, in multitrack |
| `Delete` | Silence the selection in place at the same length (or remove every selected multitrack clip, leaving the gap — and with a **gap** selected instead, close it) |
| `D` | Delete — the same view-routed command as `Delete` |
| `Shift+Delete` | Ripple Delete — editor: remove the selection and close the gap; multitrack: remove the selected clip(s) and close the gap, or close a **selected gap** |
| `Ctrl+A` | Select All — the whole file in the editor; **every clip on every track** in the multitrack view |
| `A` | Select All — the same view-routed command as `Ctrl+A` |
| `T` | Trim to Selection — editor: keeps the selected region, drops the rest; multitrack: keeps a swept **time range**, removing or shortening clips outside it |
| `S` | Silence Selection — editor: zeroes the selected region in place; multitrack: silences the swept **time range**, leaving the gap |
| `Ctrl+Left` | Previous clip edge — multitrack only |
| `Ctrl+Right` | Next clip edge — multitrack only |
| `Home` | Go to Start — the file's, or the **session's** in the multitrack view |
| `End` | Go to End — the file's, or the **end of the last clip** in the multitrack view |
| `Ctrl+O` | Open… |
| `Ctrl+S` | Save project (`.audm`, every view) |
| `Ctrl+Shift+S` | Save project As… |
| `Ctrl+N` | New… |
| `Ctrl+W` | Close |
| `M` | Add Marker at the cursor (editor views only) |
| `Ctrl+E` | Export… |
| `Escape` | Deselect — the clip selection, a selected gap, or a selected **time range** in the multitrack; or, with an effect card open, closes the card (see below) |

## The multitrack-only rows

`Ctrl+Left` and `Ctrl+Right` address the **session timeline**, and their
commands report disabled anywhere else — pressed in the waveform or spectral
editor they do nothing at all, rather than doing something to a document you
cannot see. There is one global key table and no per-view table beside it:
every key runs a command, and a command re-checks its own predicate before it
runs, which is what makes a view-scoped key inert outside its view.
(`Shift+Delete` used to be in this list; it now ripples the editor's selection
too — see the table above.) `Ctrl+K`/`C` is not the only view-routed edit key
any more: `T` and `S` now act on the selection in the editors and on a swept
**time range** in multitrack (see *Selecting a stretch of time* in the User
Guide), the same way `Ctrl+K`/`C` drops a marker in the editors and splits
clips at the edit cursor in multitrack, where it is greyed with nothing
selected.

**Join Clips** (renamed from Merge Clips) — Split's inverse — is bound to
`J`. You can also reach it through the edit pill's **Join** button or
**Edit → Join Clips**; both are multitrack-only and both stay greyed until
some track has two or more of its clips selected. The Pipeline's
**Separate Voice** and **Podcast Chain** still have no key at all: neither
binds one, and both are reached from the Pipeline menu or the Pipeline
module card.

**Selecting a gap has no key either.** A gap — the empty stretch on one track
between two of its clips, or between the start of the timeline and its first
clip — is selected only by **double-clicking** it (the gesture table below), and
put away by `Escape` or by a plain click on empty lane space outside it. Once it
is selected, `Del` and `Shift+Del` both **close** it: every later clip on that
track moves left by the gap's length, in one undo step, and no other track
moves. There is deliberately no key that selects one — a key would have to guess
which gap you meant, and the pointer already says.

**Zoom anchors on the position line.** `Ctrl`+wheel in the multitrack — and in
the waveform and spectral views, and the toolbar's `−`/`+` in all three — zooms
toward the edit line, not the pointer: the line keeps its place on screen, and
when it is off screen the new view is centred on it. `Shift`+wheel scrolls and
**Fit** are unaffected.

The rest of the multitrack clip verbs are mouse gestures rather than table rows:

| Gesture | What it does |
|---|---|
| Double-click **empty lane space** | Selects the **gap** it landed in — the span between the two clips that bound it, or between sample 0 and the first clip. It draws as a translucent band the full height of that lane, and it replaces the clip selection (one selection on screen at a time). The open stretch after the last clip is not a gap, and neither is anywhere two clips overlap |
| A plain click on **empty lane space** | Clears the clip selection, and puts a selected gap away too — unless the click lands inside that band's own span, which is the first half of the double-click that would re-select it |
| `Ctrl+Click` on a clip | Adds it to the selection (or takes it back out). The clip you clicked last is the one the Properties panel's fields edit |
| `Shift+Click` on a clip | Extends the selection from the last-clicked clip to this one, taking every clip between them **on that track**. Across tracks it acts as a plain click. It adds to what is already selected, so it composes with `Ctrl+Click`; with both modifiers held, `Ctrl` wins and the click is a toggle |
| Drag any selected clip | Moves **every** selected clip by the same amount, as one undo step. Every member previews the move live, so what you see is what lands |
| Drag a group onto another track | The clip you grabbed joins the track under the pointer and the others shift by the same number of tracks, so the group keeps its shape. If that would push any member off the top or bottom of the track list, **nothing changes track** — the group is never scattered, and the highlighted lane is the one the grabbed clip will actually land on |
| `Ctrl` held at the **drop** of a **single-clip** drag | Still the push-clear nudge it has always been — the clip is pushed past the neighbour it would have overlapped, instead of crossfading into it |
| `Ctrl` held at the drop of a **group** drag (2+ clips) | **Nothing.** A group drag has no nudge in this version: pushing only the colliding member clear would change the spacing between the clips you are dragging, and a group drag that deforms the group is not the gesture you made. The group lands where you dropped it, and any overlap it creates arms a crossfade as usual |
| `Shift`+press-and-drag on a lane's background (or the gutter below the tracks) | Sweeps a **time range** across every track — the band `T` (Trim) and `S` (Silence) act on. It cannot start on a clip — `Shift+Click` there extends the clip selection instead (above). A press that never moves just clears whatever was selected, the same as a plain click |

In neither case does a held `Ctrl` toggle the selection — that is what
`Ctrl+Click` does, and a drag is not a click. The hint that appears over an
overlap mid-drag offers the `Ctrl` nudge only on a single-clip drag, for the
same reason.

**`Edit → Ripple Delete Time Selection`** has no key and is still greyed out in
every view. The gesture it needs now exists — `Shift`+drag a lane sweeps a
time range (above) — but a *rippling* delete across every track raises
questions the range itself does not answer: which tracks shift when one is
removed from all of them, and whether a track the range never touches should
shift too. `T` (Trim) and `S` (Silence) are the non-rippling form that ships
today: each clears the range on its scoped tracks and leaves the hole, the
same way a plain `Delete` leaves a gap. The row carries no combo
deliberately — a matched combo is claimed before the command's own predicate is
consulted, so a key bound to a permanently disabled row would be swallowed in
every view and give nothing back.

## `Escape` and the two kinds of surface

`Escape` means one thing in the table above and another over a **modal dialog**,
since the Pipeline module it means nothing at all over a hosted pipeline tool,
and over an effect card it means what it meant when the effect was a dialog:

| Surface | What `Escape` does |
|---|---|
| The editor (nothing open) | Deselect, as above |
| The **multitrack** view | Clears the clip selection, a selected gap, or a selected time range — the document selection behind them is not on screen there, so clearing that instead would be an edit with no feedback anywhere |
| A modal dialog (New File, Export, Convert, Record) | Closes the topmost one — unless it is mid-run, when it refuses |
| A **pipeline tool** in the module column (Match Tempo, Vocal Chain, Cover Chain, Transcribe, …) | Nothing. Close it with the **✕** in its header |
| An **effect card** in the module column, idle | **Closes the card** — the same as its **✕** or **Cancel**: a running **Preview** is stopped and the real document goes back to the engine. The selection is kept: the key does *not* fall through to Deselect |
| An **effect card** while **Apply** is running | Nothing, like the ✕ — the pass is never discarded. The key comes back when it finishes |
| A modal dialog opened over an effect card | The modal's: it closes, the card stays |

The pipeline-tool row is deliberate. A hosted tool is not modal — the stage
behind it stays live — so it installs no `Escape` handler of its own; taking
the key would make it a focus trap wearing a different shape. The **✕** is its
dismissal, and mid-pass that ✕ refuses and says why.

The effect card is the one hosted surface that does take the key, and it takes
only that key: an effect was a dialog until the 2026-08-18 program moved it
into the column, and `Escape` closed that dialog. Closing the card is what the
key means there — and not clearing the selection is the
point, because the card resolves the region it writes from the **live**
selection when Apply runs, reading "no selection" as the whole file; an
`Escape` that deselected instead would have quietly widened the next **Apply**
from the span you just previewed to the entire document. (Edit › Deselect and a
click on the waveform still do clear it beside an open card, and the card's
first line — "Selection — 0:01.500 → 0:03.500 (2.00 s)" / "Whole file —
5:00.000" — says so before you press Apply.) Two small rules keep the key
honest: `Escape` typed in a text field *outside* the card — a marker's inline
rename, say — belongs to that field, as every global key does; and with a
modal open over the card, the modal has it.

## Menu-only commands (no bound key)

These are reachable from the menus — File, Edit, Effects, Pipeline, View and
Help — but appear in no row of the key table above: none of them binds a key.
The list is derived from `src/services/menuActions.ts` (its `LAYOUT` plus the
effect-registry loop): every menu command registered without a `shortcut` is
here.

| Command | Menu location |
|---|---|
| Record | File → Record, or the transport bar's record button |
| Open Project… | File menu |
| Mix Down to New File | File menu, multitrack-only |
| Ripple Delete Time Selection | Edit menu — permanently greyed and deliberately key-less; see above |
| Convert Sample Rate… / Convert Channels… | Edit menu |
| Insert Active File at Cursor / Add Track | Edit menu, multitrack-only |
| Next Marker / Previous Marker | Edit menu |
| Capture Noise Print | Effects menu, top row (needs a selection in waveform/spectral, or one selected clip in multitrack) |
| Every effect in the rack | Effects menu — one row per registered effect under its category heading, each opening that effect's card in the module column; no effect has a key |
| Spatial Positioner | Effects menu, the closing Mix group |
| Detect Tempo / Match Tempo / Align Vocal Timing / Auto-Remix | Pipeline menu, Tempo & Timing group |
| Separate Voice / Voice Changer / Vocal Chain / Cover Chain / Podcast Chain / Align Lyrics | Pipeline menu, Voice group |
| Transcribe / Separate into Stems | Pipeline menu, Analysis group |
| Waveform / Spectral / Multitrack | View menu |
| Spectral: Toggle Log/Linear Scale / Toggle Beat Grid / Toggle Snap to Grid | View menu |
| About Auditorium | Help menu |

Two transport commands are key-less AND menu-less — their only door is the
transport bar itself:

| Command | Where |
|---|---|
| Stop | Transport bar stop button |
| Loop toggle | Transport bar loop button |
