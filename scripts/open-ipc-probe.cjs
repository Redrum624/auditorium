// T4 — the IPC-delivery stall probe. A MEASUREMENT, not a gate: it prints
// numbers and writes a verdict JSON, and exits 0 whatever they say.
//
// The claim on trial is the one the O1 round recorded and did not attempt:
//
//   "190-300 ms main-thread block is the IPC delivery itself (ipcRenderer is
//    main-thread-only) + 123-160 ms post-open pyramids/first-draw."
//
// and beside it "the bridge-copy floor" — `contextBridge` COPIES anything a
// preload method returns, so a 65 MiB read costs a second 65 MiB at the hand-off
// no matter what the reader does.
//
// Both are about opening a FILE, not about pressing play; the brief that
// commissioned this probe described it as play-press latency, and the ledger
// entry it cites is `file:read`. The ledger is what is measured here.
//
// What it isolates, per read, inside the real built app:
//
//   * `deliverMs`   — `await window.electronAPI.readFile(path)`, wall clock.
//     This is main→renderer IPC transfer + structured-clone deserialisation +
//     the contextBridge copy of the return value. Everything the renderer pays
//     before it owns the bytes.
//   * `blockMs`     — the LONGEST gap between ticks of a 4 ms interval running
//     across that await. A promise that resolves after 200 ms of idle waiting
//     and one that resolves after 200 ms of blocked main thread are the same
//     `deliverMs` and completely different bugs; this is the number the ledger's
//     claim is actually about.
//   * `copyMs`      — an in-renderer `slice()` of the same buffer. The floor a
//     copy of this many bytes costs on this machine, so the delivery can be
//     compared against "one copy" rather than against zero.
//
// A small file is measured too, as the control that separates fixed per-call
// overhead from per-byte cost.
