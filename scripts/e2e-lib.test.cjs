 * to find the app. Every rig that drives the built app had to change, and the
 * change is worth a test because the failure it prevents is silent: a rig that

 * crashed — it would have reported the geometry it asked for and then failed
 * somewhere much further downstream, or worse, passed.

 * The splash is deliberately NOT disabled under AUDITORIUM_TEST. A feature
 * switched off under test is a feature that only works where nobody is looking,
