/**
 * Task S5 — multitrack landing for a completed stem separation (plan ruling 6).
 *
 * Takes the in-memory {@link StemSeparationOutput} that `stemService`'s
 * `separateStems` resolves with and turns it into what the user actually works
 * with: FIVE documents (`<source> — Drums` … `<source> — Residual`) plus a
 * fresh multitrack session holding one full-length clip per stem, then switches
 * to the multitrack view. This module synthesises no audio — every sample it
 * lands is a `Float32Array` handed over by S3 verbatim (or, for a mono source,
 * a bit-exact copy of one; see MONO below).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE GUARANTEE THIS MODULE MUST NOT BREAK (plan ruling 1)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `residual := mix − Σ stems` is a time-domain complement, so the five tracks
 * sum back to the source EXACTLY — "down to the sample, not to a tolerance".
 * That only survives the mix bus if every track contributes its stored sample
 * values UNCHANGED, which means:
 *
 *  - **Track order matters.** Residual is LAST because `partitionStems`
 *    computed it as the float32 remainder AFTER the four stems were summed in
 *    ruling-6 order; `mixdownSession` accumulates track by track with a float32
 *    store per `+=`, so replaying that same order is what makes
 *    `Σ stems + (mix − Σ stems)` collapse back to `mix` sample for sample.
 *  - **Every param stays at its default** — unity gain, centre pan, no
 *    mute/solo. Not "defaults except a magic number the user must not touch":
 *    a session whose exactness depended on a non-default fader would silently
 *    lose the guarantee the first time someone reset that fader.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * MONO — measured, not assumed (plan ruling 6: "compensated if needed —
 * measure, don't assume")
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `mixdownSession` picks its pan law from the CLIP SOURCE's channel count. A
 * mono clip takes the constant-power law (`monoPanGains`), which at centre is
 * `gL = gR = cos(π/4) ≈ 0.7071` — the single channel feeds both master sides at
 * −3 dB. Five mono stem tracks at unity therefore sum to 0.707 × the source:
 * S2's review measured 0.205 absolute (−13.8 dBFS), and this module's own
 * acceptance test reproduces it (0.196 @ 44.1 kHz, 0.198 @ 48 kHz) whenever the
 * routing below is removed. A STEREO clip takes the balance law
 * (`stereoBalanceGains`), which IS unity at centre — which is why only mono
 * needs anything at all.
 *
 * **The mechanism: a mono source's stems are laid down as DUAL-MONO STEREO
 * documents** (channel 0 and channel 1 are both bit-exact copies of the mono
 * stem), so every stem clip takes the unity balance law and each master side
 * receives the stem samples unmultiplied. It is exact BY CONSTRUCTION — the
 * mono path becomes the same arithmetic as the stereo path, not a second path
 * that happens to agree.
 *
 * The alternative — mono documents plus a per-track fader of 20·log10(√2)
 * ≈ +3.0103 dB, the exact inverse of the law — was implemented and MEASURED,
 * and it does NOT reach exactness:
 *
 * | mono routing                   | worst \|err\| | dBFS   | bit-exact samples |
 * |--------------------------------|---------------|--------|-------------------|
 * | none (unity fader, mono docs)  | 1.96e-1       | −14.1  | 0 %               |
 * | +3.0103 dB fader, mono docs    | 5.96e-8       | −144.5 | 97.47 %           |
 * | dual-mono stereo docs (SHIPPED)| 0             | −∞     | 100 %             |
 *
 * The fader's residue is not a bug to hunt down, it is arithmetic: mixdown
 * computes `(x · g) · gL` with TWO float64 roundings, and `g · gL` is
 * 1.0000000000000002 rather than 1, because `gL`'s exact reciprocal is not a
 * representable double (so no scalar `g` can make that product the identity —
 * this is a proof, not a tuning failure). The resulting ≤3.14e-16 relative
 * perturbation is ~8 orders below float32 granularity, yet it still flips the
 * master bus's float32 rounding on 2.5 % of samples, each by one ULP. Ruling 1
 * says "not to a tolerance", so the fader route is rejected.
 *
 * Cost of the shipped route, stated plainly: a mono source's five stem
 * documents occupy twice what mono stems would — i.e. exactly what a STEREO
 * source of the same duration already costs, which is the envelope S3's
 * 15-minute cap was sized against, so it introduces no new worst case. The two
 * channels are independent copies, never the same array aliased twice: nothing
 * else in this codebase creates an aliased document and a future in-place
 * mutation would corrupt one channel through the other.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE CONDITION THE GUARANTEE CARRIES (S2 review, measured)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `mixdownSession` HARD CLAMPS the master bus to ±1 (`mixdown.ts:165-166`,
 * applied at `:626-627` — not `:68-70,155-158`, which is `dbToLinear` and the
 * spatial pan gain).
 * A document whose samples exceed full scale — reachable after gain/EQ inside
 * the app — therefore reconstructs with large error (S2 measured 0.600 at
 * |mix| = 1.6) even though the raw sum is still exact. That clamp is documented
 * v1 behaviour and is deliberately NOT defeated here. Instead the condition is
 * DETECTED and reported: {@link StemLandingResult.sourcePeak} and
 * {@link StemLandingResult.exactSumHolds} tell the caller (S6's dialog, S7's
 * smoke) whether the identity actually holds for THIS document, so the user can
 * be told the truth rather than being sold a guarantee that silently doesn't
 * hold.

 * two tracks. No second model run and no second download: the caller hands
 * over an output it already has.

 * stem with every sample outside those spans taken to silence and each kept
 * span faded at its edges — `keepSpans`, whose header explains the 10 ms ramp.
 * `<source> — Backing` is the same sum `landVoice` lands, unchanged.
 *
 * WHAT THIS LANDING DOES NOT CLAIM. The speaker tracks plus the Backing do NOT
 * reconstruct the source sample for sample, and this module says so rather than
 * carrying a tolerance: the edge fades remove a little audio at every turn, and
 * a region where two speakers overlap is carried by BOTH of their documents, so
 * it is present twice on the mix bus. `landStems`' exact-sum guarantee and
 * `landVoice`'s measured 4.32e-7 both belong to partitions of the source; a
 * speaker split is not one. The Backing on its own still adds back to the
 * source as it always did — that half is untouched.
 *
 * That is why the result's `exactSumHolds` is `null` here and not the
 * peak-derived verdict every other landing returns (D4: "No exact-sum claim for
 * speakers"). `null` is the field's own "no claim in either direction" value —
 * the one S5's dialog renders as silence — and it is the only honest answer: a
 * `true` earned by an in-range source peak would promise an identity this
 * landing never had, while `false` would blame the master bus's ±1 clamp for a
 * difference the fades and the shared overlap cause. `sourcePeak` is still
 * reported, because that IS a fact about the source.
 *
 * A confirmed count of ONE is `landVoice`, not a one-speaker mask: the whole
 * stem lands as `Voice`, unmasked and by reference, because there is nobody to
 * separate it from and the fades would only shave the edges off the user's own
 * speech. Zero span arrays take the same route — D5's "no distinct speakers
 * were found — the voice will land as one track".
 *

 * halves: unsaved documents carrying the source's beat-grid provenance, Speaker
 * 1 active, a fresh session at the output rate with one full-length clip per
