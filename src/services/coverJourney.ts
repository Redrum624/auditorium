/**
 * Task CP1 — the Cover Chain as the whole journey.
 *
 * ── Why this module exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The shipped Cover Chain (F10) matched a take's tone and level to an original
 * vocal and then listed five things the user had to do BY HAND either side of
 * it: separate the song, run the Vocal Chain, repair words, align timing, and
 * build the session. Every one of those was a defensible engineering decision
 * and the sum of them was not the product the name promises. The user, after
 * running it: "you are supposed to input the original song AND the vocals,
 * clean the vocals, align with original, remove the vocals from original, add
 * cleaned vocals to music of original, smooth."
 *
 * So this module is that sentence, in order, unattended. It is ORCHESTRATION
 * and it contains no DSP: every stage below is an existing, reviewed, shipped
 * service called with the right inputs in the right order.
 *
 *   1. Separate      → `stemService.separateStems` + `stemLanding.createStemDocuments`
 *   2. Clean         → `vocalChain.runVocalChain`
 *   3. Align         → `dsp/coverAlign.alignTakeToReference`
 *   4. Match         → `coverChain.runCoverChain`, the four stages unchanged
 *   5. Place         → `multitrack/session` + the load-shaped session apply
 *   6. Smooth        → the v1.9 clip fades + `mixdown.mixdownSessionPeak`
 *
 * The one genuinely new thing is the alignment, and it lives in `dsp/coverAlign`
 * with its own ground-truth tests and a threshold it measured.
 *
 * ── What is still manual, and why it always will be ─────────────────────────
 * Align Lyrics. It replaces ONE word the user picks with a fresh take of that
 * word, and nothing in the app judges which word that should be — a per-phone
 * quality scorer was built, measured 0.642 AUC against a 0.500 chance baseline,
 * and was cut. Align Vocal Timing stays manual for Ruling E's reason (it needs
 * a confirmed grid). Both are listed as optional refinements AFTER the run,
 * because the run's alignment is a PLACEMENT and neither of those is.
 *
 * ── Cancellation, and what a cancelled run leaves behind ────────────────────
 * A run spans minutes and separation dominates it, so Cancel has to work. The
 * flag is checked between stages and inside separation (whose own
 * `cancelStemSeparation` is forwarded). The artifact story is deliberately
 * simple and is stated in the dialog rather than left to be discovered: THE
 * SESSION IS BUILT ONLY AT STAGE 5, so cancelling before then leaves documents
 * — the stems, and a take with whatever passes already committed — and no
 * session at all. Nothing is half-built, because nothing before stage 5 builds
 * anything jointly.
 *
 * CC4 (CJ-1): that sentence used to be false in the fresh-separation arm, which
 * called `stemLanding.landStems` — documents AND a `<song> — Stems` session that
 * replaced the user's, with its undo history cleared — at stage 1. Stage 1 now
 * calls `createStemDocuments`, the documents half only, so the contract above is
 * something the code does rather than something this comment claims. The
 * standalone Separate dialog still calls the whole `landStems`, because
 * replacing the session is what that dialog is for and it says so.
 *
 * ── Undo ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Each sub-pass keeps its OWN undo entry, the chains' own precedent: "Vocal
 * Chain" and "Cover Chain" are two entries on the take, the stem documents are
 * creations rather than edits (nothing to undo), and the session replacement is
 * load-shaped and clears session history exactly as Open Project and stem
 * landing do. The report lists every entry the pass left.
 *
 * ONE undo entry across all of it is NOT attempted, and that is a decision
 * rather than an omission: undo entries are per-document, and a single entry
 * spanning two documents plus a session replacement is a data-model change
 * (`editOps`/`sessionUndo` would both have to learn a joint scope). Noted as
 * future work; not smuggled in behind a cover feature.

 * T3 (V4 MIN-5). Why the level trim's arithmetic is allowed to work the way it
 * does — stated, and checked, instead of held by construction alone.
 *
 * The trim clamps ONCE, to the delta both tracks share
 * (`clampAutomationValue('volumeDb', -wanted)`), and then writes
 * `t.volumeDb + faderDb` to each. Two facts make that valid, and neither is
 * enforced anywhere else in the system:
 *
 *  - **Every fader starts at 0.** `setTrackParam` stores its patch verbatim
 *    with no clamp of its own (`sessionStore.ts`), so on a track that started
 *    below 0 the sum can land past the −60 dB floor — a level the mixer strip
 *    cannot show and the automation layer would refuse — while the stage's
 *    warning goes on quoting the floor as though it had been respected.
 *  - **No track carries a volume LANE.** A lane OVERRIDES the static fader
 *    rather than offsetting it (F0's override-not-offset ruling), so the write
 *    would land and change nothing audible: the trim inert, the second
 *    summation still over, and the `stillOver` copy blaming the fader floor for
 *    a floor that was never reached.
 *
 * Both hold because stage 5 builds this session two stages earlier, through
 * `createTrack` (fader 0) and with no automation. That is exactly why this
 * THROWS rather than declining: a violation is this module contradicting
 * itself, not a state a user can arrive in, and the journey's own catch turns a
 * throw into a failed stage carrying the reason. Trimming the wrong amount
 * quietly is the outcome worth refusing.
 *
 * Returns the reason the trim may not proceed, or `null`.

    // two full-length documents with the SAME name open, a third after a third
    // pass, at ~85 MB apiece for a four-minute stereo song.
    //
    // The adoption precondition is `findExistingSeparation`'s, verbatim: the
    // name this pass gives it, the song's sample rate, and the song's exact
    // length. That is the same test a stem must pass to inherit the song's beat
    // grid, and it is what makes adoption safe — a copy that no longer matches
    // is left alone and a fresh one is created beside it, exactly as before.

    // CC4 fix-round 2 (N1/N2/N3): and adoption REWRITES NOTHING. A candidate is
    // adopted only when `holdsExactly` proves it already IS the sum this pass
    // computed, which makes reuse a no-op that cannot destroy anything — see
    // that function for why a content test rather than a provenance one is the
    // only thing that survives a project save and reopen. Anything else — the
    // user's edit, a stale sum, another song's — is left exactly where it is and
    // this pass creates its own document beside it.
    //
    // One consequence of adopting rather than copying, stated because round 1
    // did not have it (round-2 re-review, Note 3): the document stage 5 hangs
    // the `Instrumental` clip on is the USER'S, live, with its undo stack
    // intact. A copy they edited and then UNDID holds this sum again and is

    // changes the audio under the built session's instrumental clip. That is
    // the app's model everywhere (a clip references a live document, and any
    // later edit to an adopted copy does the same), and it is the price of not
    // spending an ~85 MB document on a case that is provably a no-op — but it
    // is a consequence worth being able to read here rather than discover.
    //
    // EVERY name-matching candidate is tested, not just the first (N2): a user
    // who edits the pass-1 copy once would otherwise have the pass re-find that
