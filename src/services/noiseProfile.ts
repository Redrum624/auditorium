/**
 * Noise print capture (Task 19). `captureNoiseProfile` reads the active document
 * and its selection from the store (falling back to the whole document when there
 * is no selection), and stores — per channel — the average STFT magnitude
 * spectrum (fftSize 2048, hop 512) across all frames of that region. The result
 * lives in a module-level slot consumed later by the Noise Reduction effect
 * (surfaced to the DSP worker as `extra.spectra`) and cleared explicitly.
 *
 * Task F8: the profile records the docId it was captured from so it can be
 * cleared when that document closes (see fileService.closeDocumentFlow), and a
 * version counter + `useNoiseProfileVersion()` (useSyncExternalStore) let React
 * consumers (EffectDialog's hasNoiseProfile) re-render on capture/clear.
