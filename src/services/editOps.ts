/**
 * Declarative description of how a length/timeline-changing edit moves marker
 * positions (Task M3 / F4), derived by each editOps call site from the same
 * region args it passes to the AudioDocument mutator. `applyEdit` turns this
 * into a full before/after marker-list remap that rides inside the SAME undo
 * entry as the document swap. Omit entirely for equal-length transforms
 * (effects, reverse, in-place silence, delete, cut, ...) — markers stay
 * untouched and no marker snapshot is taken.
 *
 * Rules (all in PRE-edit sample coordinates, region args are [start, end)):
 * - delete [s,e): < s keep; in [s,e) drop; >= e shift left by (e-s).
 * - insert at `start` of `length` L: < start keep; >= start shift right by L.
 * - replace [s,e) with length L: < s keep; in [s,e) drop; >= e shift by L-(e-s).
 * - trim to [s,e]: END-INCLUSIVE — outside [s,e] drops; inside (including a
 *   marker sitting exactly at `e`) shifts left by s, so a marker at exactly the
 *   old docLength survives a select-all trim landing at the new length exactly.
 *   [Amended 2026-07-25, M3 review: the original half-open [s,e) reading
 *   silently dropped end-of-file markers on trim.]
 * - rescale (sample-rate conversion): round(pos * toRate/fromRate).
 * - stretch region [s,e) to length L (length-changing effects — Time Stretch,
 *   Pitch Shift): < s keep; in [s,e) map PROPORTIONALLY,
 *   s + round((pos-s) * L/(e-s)) — the audio inside is TRANSFORMED, not
 *   replaced with unrelated content, so interior markers ride the stretch
 *   instead of dropping; >= e shift by L-(e-s). Degenerate e===s (empty
 *   region) falls through to the >= e shift for every pos, since no pos can
 *   satisfy `s <= pos < e` when e===s. [Amended 2026-07-25 (fix round 2):
 *   effectRunner originally used 'replace' here, which drops every interior
 *   marker — including all of them on a whole-file Time Stretch. Reviewed and
 *   ruled proportional.]
 * - cuts (F2, Remove Silence): `cuts` is a sorted, non-overlapping list of
 *   deleted [start,end) spans. Before the first cut keep; at/after a cut's
 *   end shift left by the total length of every cut at or before it; INSIDE
 *   a cut, snap to the cut's join point (cut.start minus the removal before
 *   it) rather than drop. Deliberate divergence from 'delete': there the
 *   USER deleted that region, content and cues included; here the effect
 *   removed samples it classified as silence, and a marker inside a silent
 *   gap is typically a cue placed IN the pause (podcast chapter markers live
 *   exactly there) — dropping it would be the data-loss-class failure the
 *   marker remap exists to prevent, while the join point is exactly where
 *   that pause survives in the output. Every branch is monotonic in pos, so
 *   relative marker order is preserved. Boundary equivalences, argued not
 *   assumed: at pos === cut.start the snap equals the keep-side formula, and
 *   at pos === cut.end the snap equals the shift-side formula (both reduce
 *   to cut.start - removedBefore), so the rule is seamless at both edges.
 * - compose (F7, Vocal Chain): apply `steps` LEFT TO RIGHT, each in the
 *   coordinates the previous one produced; a step that drops a marker ends
 *   the chain for that marker (null propagates). It exists because the chain
 *   is a composition of edits committed as ONE undo entry, so its marker rule
 *   has to be the composition of its stages' rules — Remove Silence's 'cuts'
 *   followed by the 'insert' of a Reverb tail is the shipped case. An empty
 *   `steps` is the identity, which is what a chain of equal-length stages
 *   correctly produces.

 *
 * No `bytes` is attached (Task M9 / F15): `before`/`after` are plain marker
 * lists, never a channel array, so their retained cost is negligible next to
 * `MAX_UNDO_BYTES` and isn't counted toward the per-doc budget.
 *
 * Since lot B the close prompt reads `dirty` alone (`neverSaved` no longer
 * arms it), so this stamp is now the ONLY thing standing between a bulk

 * markers, the cursor and the allocation a different region from the one the
 * audio used. Two verified consequences on a 4000-sample document:
 * Cut with `{-5000, 100}` removed `[0,100)` but emitted a `delete` remap over
 * `[-5000,100)`, shifting a marker at 500 by 5100 into `remapMarkers`' floor at
 * 0 instead of 400, and left the cursor at −5000; Silence with `{2000, 9000}`
 * allocated 7000 zeros while `replaceRegion` removed only the 2000 samples that
 * exist, GROWING the document 4000 → 9000 — the one operation documented as
 * leaving length unchanged. No UI route builds such a selection (the editor
 * gestures clamp, select-all uses `docLength`), so both were latent; the store
 * API is public and `setSelection`/`setCursor` store whatever they are handed.
 *
 * T6-1: the two expressions this used to hold are `selectionRegion.ts`, which
 * six modules had each written out for themselves. The paragraph above stays
 * because it records the two verified consequences that earned the ruling; the
 * arithmetic does not, because a ruling six modules re-type is a ruling one edit
 * can break in five of them.
 *

 * the resolved selection edges are used, not the raw pair. A position at 0 or
 * at the document end is implicit (M3) and a position that already carries a
 * marker is skipped; when nothing is left nothing is recorded (and the anchor
 * below is left untouched — a press that cuts nothing has nothing to anchor).
 *
 * Item 7 (G1-G6): what happens to the SELECTION after that marker write, now
 * narrowed from "selection and cursor are not touched" (the original
 * contract, overturned here per X1) to this:
 *
 *  - SELECTION ARM (a selection was standing): still writes no selection —
 *    the standing selection already IS the span between the two cut points it
 *    just marked (G1, pinned at `editOps.test.ts`'s "with a selection" case).
 *    The anchor becomes this cut's own trailing edge (the resolved selection's
 *    `end`); when that edge is the document end it carries no marker (the
 *    `fresh` filter above skips implicit positions), so a later split's anchor
 *    gate fails and falls back to no-anchor, correctly.
 *  - CURSOR ARM: honours `lastSplitMarker` (G6) only when it names THIS
 *    document and a marker still stands at its `positionSample` in the
 *    PRE-split marker list — an undo of the split that made it, the marker
 *    being moved/deleted, or a document switch (`activationReset` clears the
 *    field outright) all read as "no anchor". When live, the two markers
 *    (the anchor's and this cut's, `p`) bound a segment via `segmentAt` — the
 *    ONE segment definition this module shares with the double-click gesture
 *    and `cutSelection` (G5: "the pieces are marker-bounded segments") — found
 *    by probing one sample INSIDE the newer cut, on the anchor's side of it
 *    (leftward cuts, G3, probe the other direction). `p` can never equal the
 *    anchor's position: `taken` already excluded it above.
 *
 * Both arms finish by writing `lastSplitMarker` to this cut's own position, so
 * a THIRD cut keeps narrowing to the newest pair (G1's "every later split").
 * The selection write is deliberately OUTSIDE the undo entry: `pushMarkerUndo`
 * snapshots only the marker list, and undoing a split restores the markers
 * while leaving the selection exactly where this call left it. One visible
 * consequence: after a second cut, `Ctrl+X` (`cutSelection`) cuts the selected
 * MIDDLE PIECE rather than the cursor's segment (`editOps.ts`'s `cutSelection`,
 * `menuActions.ts`'s `edit.cut`) — the flow item 7 asks for.
