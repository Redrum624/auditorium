/**
 * Task CC3 — what a REFUSED alignment is allowed to do about itself.
 *
 * ── Why this module exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The Cover Chain journey measures an offset, decides it is not believable,
 * places the take at zero, and — until this module — threw the number away
 * into a sentence. A user hit that with a −8.258 s guess and was told to "drag
 * it on the timeline, or run Align Vocal Timing, to place it yourself". Both
 * halves of that advice were wrong for their case, and one of them is wrong
 * for every case:
 *
 *  - `moveClip` clamps every clip start to `Math.max(0, …)`, so a NEGATIVE
 *    offset is unreachable by dragging the take. Only the INSTRUMENTAL can
 *    move. The message named the one clip that could not help.
 *  - Align Vocal Timing is a marker-to-grid warp on the active document. It
 *    needs a confirmed beat grid the fresh take does not have, it moves audio
 *    inside a document rather than clips on a timeline, and its moves are
 *    bounded to half a grid interval — it cannot express "shift everything
 *    8.258 s relative to the other track" at all.
 *
 * So this module owns two things: the sentence that tells the truth about
 * which clip moves, and the one-click action that does the move so the user
 * does not have to eyeball it.
 *
 * ── V3: and for two outcomes, the pass does the move itself ─────────────────
 * CC3 shipped the action as an OFFER and said so here: the refusal stands, the
 * guess really may be wrong. Then a user ran it, was shown three candidates,
 * clicked the first, and found it right — and said the thing this module now
 * follows: "it should place the tracks by itself!". {@link autoPlaces} is that
 * sentence, and it is deliberately narrow. `'weak'` and `'ambiguous'` carry a
 * usable guess and are PLACED, with the alternatives still one click each.
 * `'unrelated'` and an unclassified measurement carry none and are still placed
 * at zero with the button beside them, because auto-placing a lag nothing could
 * distinguish from noise is not what was asked for.
 *
 * The click is therefore no longer only "accept the guess": on a placed arm it
 * is "that was the wrong one of the lags, use this one instead" — which is the
 * question the user can actually answer.
 *
 * ── The arithmetic is not a second opinion ──────────────────────────────────
 * `applyMeasuredOffset` does not reproduce the confident arm's placement — it
 * CALLS it. {@link placementFor} is the one implementation of the both-track
 * shift, and the journey's Place stage calls the same function, so the applied
 * guess lands exactly where a believed alignment would have put it and cannot
 * drift away from it. (H1: this paragraph used to restate the shift formula in
 * the pre-refactor identifiers — a third textual copy of a rule with one
 * implementation, and the copy nothing would have failed if the rule changed.
 * Read `placementFor`.)
 *
 * Around that call it lays the journey's own edge fades and parks a cursor
 * where the take enters, so the user can press play and judge the guess by ear.
 * It is one undoable gesture, so a guess that turns out wrong costs one Ctrl+Z.
