/** .audm format version. v1: no markers. v2: adds an optional `markers` map,
 * audio embedded as base64 WAV inside the JSON text. v3: audio moves out of
 * the JSON entirely into a raw binary payload, so no monolithic JS string is
 * ever built for the audio content (the V8 string-length cap made v2 throw a
 * RangeError once embedded audio crossed ~402MB — see F3). v4 (current, write
 * default — see `serializeSessionV4`; lot A, ruling M4): v3's byte layout
 * under an `AUDM4\n` magic, plus an `unreferenced` section so EVERY open
 * document is in the file (v3 embedded only clip-referenced ones), `markers`
 * for every embedded document, and an optional per-document `origin` — the
 * path the document was opened from. The loader accepts all four; only v4 is
 * written by a project save (`writeProject`).
 *
 * v1.9 (X2): clips may additionally carry OPTIONAL fade keys (`fadeInSample`,
 * `fadeOutSample`, `fadeInCurve`, `fadeOutCurve` — see `session.ts`). These
 * ride inside the existing JSON clip records: absent keys mean "no fade", so
 * every pre-fade `.audm` still loads, and the parsers spread clip records
 * through untouched, so unknown keys are simply carried. Fade keys from disk
 * are UNTRUSTED and normalized in `finalizeParsedSession` (see
 * `sanitizeClipFades`).
 *
 * Compatibility (lot A): X2 argued that bumping the version would be a
 * data-loss-class change, because `parseSessionFileV3` hard-rejects any
 * `formatVersion !== 3`. That consequence is now ACCEPTED by ruling M4 — a
 * project save must drop nothing, which v3's shape cannot express — so v4
 * files are unreadable by builds ≤ v1.35. v3, v2 and v1 files still load
