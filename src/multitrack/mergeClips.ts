 * them would be pure churn) — the selected clips of one track become ONE
 * clip spanning them, with silence in the gaps and the audio baked into a
 * new document.
 *
 * Three pieces, deliberately separate: `mergeTargets` decides WHAT merges (pure,
 * so the command's enablement asks the same question the verb answers),
 * `bakeMergedClip` renders the audio (pure, so it can be tested against the
 * offline mixdown sample for sample), and `commitMergedClips` writes the session
 * (the `splitClipsAt` shape — a `withSessionGesture` bracket around the store's
 * OWN actions, never a bespoke session mutation).
 *
 * The split between the last two is what keeps the session store's law intact:
 * this store never holds documents, so the caller mints the merged document from
 * `bakeMergedClip`'s output and hands `commitMergedClips` nothing but its id.

 * shape — rather than a bespoke session write, so overlap maintenance comes for
 * free and has no second opinion: removing a member disarms an outsider's now
 * stale facing fade through `maintainFacingFades`, and `addClip` places the
 * merged clip verbatim without inventing any fade of its own. The merged clip
 * carries `gainDb: 0` and NO fade keys because both are inside the audio now.
 *
 * THE MERGED CLIP IS ADDED FIRST, THEN THE MEMBERS ARE REMOVED. Removing first
 * would leave the session TRANSIENTLY EMPTY whenever the merge takes every clip
 * in it, and `addClip` decides "did this insert change what Fit means?" from the
 * state it finds: an empty session takes its `wasEmpty` arm and re-fits, throwing
 * away a zoom the user chose — the exact yank that arm exists to avoid. Adding
 * first also never lengthens the timeline (the merged clip ends where the last
 * member does), so the shrink-watcher that re-resolves the zoom never fires
 * either. The maintenance semantics are unchanged by the order: the merged clip
 * carries no fade keys at all — `createClip` never sets one (D4) — so
 * `preOverlapStates` can never read a pair involving it as armed
 * (`(fade ?? 0) === width` fails for every `width > 0`). That covers the LAST
 * member too, whose end TIES the merged clip's own: `crossfadableOverlap`
 * rule 2 is strict (`aEnd > bEnd`), so a tie is not even excluded by geometry
 * — it is the missing fade keys, not the containment rule, that keeps that
 * pair inert. Which is why `removeClip`'s maintenance neither arms nor
 * disarms anything against the merged clip; an outsider armed against a
 * member is still disarmed by that member's own `removeClip`.
 *
 * Entries whose members are no longer all present are skipped: the targets were
 * resolved against a session that may have moved on (an undo between the resolve
 * and the commit), and a partial merge would silently delete the survivors.
