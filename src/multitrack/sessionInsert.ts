 * MT2 — THE placement path: "put these documents on this track, starting here".
 *
 * Three call sites used to state this independently — Insert Active File
 * (`services/menuActions`), a Files-panel/Explorer drop (`laneDrop`), and the
 * `insertActiveDocAsClip` test hook (`services/testHooks`, the path the latency
 * rig and the e2e walkers drive) — and two of the three had their own inlined
 * copy of the doc-rate/session-rate conversion `documentClipLength` already
 * owns. Three copies of a placement is three places for a rate rule to be
 * missing from, which is exactly how the reported stall reached a release: the
 * rate ADOPTION below has to happen before the clip is built, in every path, or
 * the path without it silently keeps the resample.

 * Places one clip per document, laid end to end from `startSample`, inside ONE

 * Ctrl+Z), and selects the last of them unless `select: false`.
 *
 * `startSample` is stated in the session's rate AS OF THE CALL, which for a
 * drop is the rate the lane's pixel mapping resolved the drop x against. When
 * an empty session ADOPTS the first document's rate, that number is
 * re-denominated by the adoption ratio — otherwise a clip dropped at 1.000 s
 * into an empty 44.1 kHz session with a 48 kHz file would land at 0.919 s,
 * visibly not where it was let go.
 *
 * Clips land VERBATIM at the requested position: overlap is first-class since
 * X5, and THIS placement path writes no fade keys — `placeDocumentsOnTrack`
 * mints a fresh clip with no source fades to carry. `multitrack/
 * clipClipboard.ts`'s Paste (lot L) is a sibling `addClip` caller that DOES
 * write fade keys (carried over from the copied clip), so "a programmatic
 * placement never writes fades" is no longer true of `addClip` callers in
 * general — see that module's own docblock for the overlap consequence.
 *
 * Returns the clips placed, newest last; `[]` for an unknown track or no
 * documents.
