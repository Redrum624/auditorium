/**
 * Task F11-4 — dropping audio onto a track lane, from either of the two places
 * a user can drag audio FROM.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ONE PLACEMENT, TWO SOURCES
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A row in the Files panel is a document the app already holds; a file dragged
 * out of Explorer is one it does not. The difference is entirely in HOW the
 * document comes to exist, so the OS path does exactly one extra thing — it
 * runs `openFilePath`, the SAME function the Open dialog runs, rollback and
 * all — and then joins the panel path at `placeDocumentClips`. There is no
 * second import pipeline here: nothing in this module reads a file, decodes
 * one, or builds a document. A drop that fails to open leaves the app exactly
 * as `openFilePath` left it (its `rollbackOpen` already undid the half-open),
 * and no clip is placed.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE DRAG RECORD (`beginDocumentDrag`)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `dataTransfer.getData` is deliberately unreadable during `dragover` in every
 * browser — the payload is only released on `drop` — but the GHOST needs the
 * dragged document's length while the drag is still in flight, because a clip
 * snaps on either edge (`snapClipStart` takes a span, not a point). So a
 * Files-panel drag also records itself in this module on `dragstart`. The
 * payload in `dataTransfer` stays authoritative at the drop; this record only
 * answers "how long is the thing currently under the pointer", and its absence
 * degrades to a zero-length span — a head-only snap — rather than to a guess.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE HISTORY LABEL
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A drop IS an `addClip`, so it carries `addClip`'s own label, 'Add clip' —
 * the same entry the "Insert Active File" command produces, because it is the
 * same act by a different gesture. A multi-file drop follows the recording
 * precedent (`multitrackRecord`'s 'Record clip'/'Record clips'): N clips from
 * one user act fold into ONE entry, 'Add clips', so a single Ctrl+Z lifts the
 * whole drop rather than peeling files off one at a time. The bracket also
 * lets the entry's snapshot carry the resulting SELECTION, which a bare
 * `addClip` + `setSelectedClip` pair would leave out of the redo.
