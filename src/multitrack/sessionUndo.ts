/**
 * R3 — the multitrack session's undo timeline, layered on the SAME per-key
 * history machinery documents use (`undoHistory.ts`): the session is "another
 * document" to that module (ruling 1), so `UNDO_LIMIT`, the History panel's
 * version counter and the stack mechanics are shared, not re-implemented.
 *
 * What this module adds is what the brief calls transaction boundaries and
 * coalescing (ruling 2 / trap T13): the store is immutable, so a previous
 * state object already IS a valid undo record — but a trim or fade drag
 * commits live on every pointermove, and one entry per store write would blow
 * `UNDO_LIMIT = 50` inside a single drag, evicting the user's real history.
 * Entries are therefore created at GESTURE boundaries:
 *
 *  - a plain recorded mutation (a click, a blur commit, a programmatic call)
 *    pushes exactly one entry by itself;
 *  - `beginSessionGesture`/`endSessionGesture` bracket a multi-write gesture
 *    (pointerdown -> pointerup): writes inside the bracket push nothing, and
 *    `end` diffs the begin/end snapshots into at most ONE entry;
 *  - contiguous single-write commits that name the same `coalesceKey` (e.g.
 *    repeated arrow-key taps on the elevation slider, each committing per
 *    keyup) merge into the previous entry instead of pushing a new one — see
 *    the coalescing rule on `SESSION_COALESCE_WINDOW_MS`.
 *
 * THE RECORDING INVARIANT: every write that replaces `SessionState.session`
 * must either go through a recorded store action (`recordSessionMutation`,
 * wired inside every `sessionStore` mutation) or be followed by
 * `clearSessionHistory()` (the load-shaped flows: Open Project, stem landing).
 * An unrecorded session write would not itself be undoable AND would be
 * silently reverted by the next undo of an OLDER entry, because entries are
 * whole-state snapshots — worse than either recording or clearing.
 */

/**
 * The reserved history key for the session's stack (ruling 1). Collision with
 * a real document id is impossible BY CONSTRUCTION, not convention: every
 * document id the app can ever hold comes from `nextId(prefix)`
 * (`AudioDocument.ts:34`), which returns `` `${prefix}-${counter}` `` where
 * `prefix` is always a compile-time literal identifier ('doc') and `counter`
 * a decimal integer — no code path can put U+0000 into such a string, and
 * this key contains one. (Session `.audm` files persist track/clip ids, never
 * document ids: `sessionFile.ts` recreates embedded documents with fresh
 * `nextId('doc')` ids on open.)

/**
 * What a session undo entry restores — and, by omission, ruling 3's pin on
 * view state. `session` is the document-like structural state. Of the six
 * view-state fields, ONLY `selectedClipId` rides the snapshot: restoring the
 * selection makes the result of an undo comprehensible (undoing a clip
 * removal re-selects the clip; undoing a move keeps the moved clip selected),
 * while restoring the cursor, zoom, transport state, playhead or the open
 * envelope lane would yank the user's viewport and transport around for no
 * comprehension gain. Pinned by sessionUndo tests: an undo/redo never touches
 * `mtCursorSample`, `mtZoom`, `mtPlayState`, `mtPlayheadSample` or
 * `mtEnvelope`.
 *
 * Snapshots are plain references into the immutable store state — no cloning
 * (the preflight's R3-5 finding). They retain NO audio: `Clip.documentId` is
 * an id string, never a document or channel-array reference, so a session
 * entry's retained cost is a few KB of structural objects (measured in
 * sessionUndo.test.ts). That is why entries carry no `bytes` — the same
 * exemption `pushMarkerUndo` documents for marker-list snapshots.
 *
 * G6 (item 7) — `SessionState.lastSplit`, the "last cut point" anchor, is NOT
 * on this list and never rides the snapshot: `sessionStore.ts`'s `apply`
 * binding actively CLEARS it on every undo and redo instead, so an anchor can
 * never be re-armed for a cut a restore just removed (or made ambiguous by
 * bringing back ids the live session had moved past).
