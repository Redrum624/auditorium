 * the sixth (undo restores a snapshot without running ANY of the actions).
 *
 * THE RULE IS "FOLLOW THE PRIMARY", and it is deliberately that narrow. The
 * primary is the field everything else already writes deliberately — it rides
 * the undo snapshot, every loader sets it, every selection action sets it — so
 * this derives the set from it and never the other way round: dead members drop

 * not restore the set), and a NULL primary means an empty set.

 * That last clause is the one worth arguing, because the obvious alternative —
 * promote a surviving member when the primary's clip is removed — is a bug
 * waiting on a real code path. `.audm` files PERSIST clip ids (`sessionFile`
 * only bumps the id counter past them), so re-opening the session you were just
 * working in restores clips carrying the very ids the stale set still names.
 * A promoting reconcile would then override the loader's explicit
 * `selectedClipId: null` and hand back a selection nobody made. A reconcile
 * that only ever REMOVES references — plus the one growth the primary itself
 * authorises — cannot override anybody's deliberate write.
 *
 * The cost is stated plainly: removing the primary out of a multi-clip
 * selection clears the whole selection rather than leaving the rest of it
 * standing. In practice the group verbs remove every member anyway
 * (`removeClips`), so the case is reachable mainly through undo/redo landing on
 * a session that is missing the primary — where "nothing is selected" is a

/**
 * MT2 — an EMPTY session takes the sample rate of the first document inserted
 * into it, and reports the ratio it moved by.
 *
 * THE REPORTED BUG. The session's rate was decided once, by
 * `makeSession(44100)` at store init, and nothing ever revisited it: two 48 kHz
 * files inserted into a session nobody had chosen a rate for were converted
 * — every sample, through the 64-tap sinc in `readClipSlice` — synchronously
 * inside `MultitrackPlayer.play()`. Measured on the packaged app with two 180 s
 * stereo clips: 22 039 ms to return from `play()` against 223 ms for the same
 * build and the same files with the session at 48 000 Hz.
 *
 * WHY "EMPTY" IS THE WHOLE CONDITION. A session's rate is the denominator of
 * every clip position, length and fade on its timeline, so changing it under
 * existing clips would mean rewriting all of them — and the second document is
 * a genuine mismatch anyway: two rates cannot both be native, and converting
 * one of them is the honest answer. But a session with NO clips denominates
 * nothing the user placed. 44 100 was a default, not a decision, so the first
 * document may as well name the rate — and then it lands at ratio 1 and the
 * resample never happens.
 *
 * WHAT ADOPTION MUST CARRY. Every session-sample number that exists at this
 * moment, because its next reader has no way to know it was left in the old
 * rate: the multitrack cursor, the live playhead, the zoom — the last one
 * re-resolved through `resolveSessionZoom` (the ONE clamp) rather than written
 * raw, so the visible DURATION survives and the ceiling is re-applied against
 * the re-denominated timeline — and (lot J) a standing TIME RANGE, both ends.
 * Adoption itself never fires with clips already on the session
 * (`hasAnyClip` below), but a range can be swept on an EMPTY session before
 * the first document is inserted, and that insert is exactly what can trigger
 * this — so a range set before the session had a rate opinion must not
 * silently name a different stretch of time once it does. The snap targets
 * are derived per render from the session and the cursor
 * (`sessionSnapTargets`), so they follow for free. `lastSplit` (G6, item 7)
 * is likewise not extended by `viewStateAtRate` below — adoption is refused
 * outright once the session holds any clip (`hasAnyClip`), so an anchor can
 * never exist yet to mis-denominate.
 *
 * Returns `newRate / oldRate` — the factor a caller must apply to any session
 * sample it computed BEFORE calling (a drop position resolved against the lane's
 * old pixel mapping, say) — or 1 when nothing changed.
 *
 * Recorded, per the sessionUndo recording invariant. The insert paths call this
 * inside their own `withSessionGesture`, so the rate change and the clip it was
 * made for fold into ONE history entry and one Ctrl+Z lifts both.

 * MT2 (fix round 1) — THE re-denomination: the rate-denominated view state,

 * the denominator forward; a snapshot restore (undo, and redo) moves it back —
 * and the restore is where it was missing, which is the whole of the fix. Both
 * are the same act: the instant a number NAMES has to survive the change of the
 * unit it is counted in, because nothing downstream can tell which unit a bare
 * sample count was written in.
 *
 * The zoom goes through `resolveSessionZoom` rather than being written raw, so
 * the re-denominated `samplesPerPixel` is re-clamped against the session it is
 * about to describe — the one clamp, applied where the ceiling moved.
 *
 * Lot J — `mtTimeRange`, both ends `Math.round`ed by the same `ratio`,
 * `null` staying `null`. This is the ONE place the range is ever
 * RE-DENOMINATED (R26 — every other writer of the field only sets or clears
 * it verbatim: `setMtTimeRange` itself, `setSelectedGap`'s J5 clear, the
 * `newSession`/`installSession` resets, and the store's own initial
 * literal), so an adoption (or an undo/redo that crosses one —

 * the subtraction happens here (`laneWidthFromScrollerWidth`) rather than in
 * the view, where it would be a number nothing tests.
 *
 * This is also the FIRST moment the real width is knowable, so like the
 * editor's twin it has two arms:
 *
 *  - a session that was sitting at the fit stays at the fit — a fitted view
 *    stays fitted across a window resize, the only reading of Fit that survives
 *    the user dragging the window edge;
 *  - anything zoomed in is merely re-resolved, which re-clamps the scroll to
 *    the new lane without throwing away where the user was looking.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT (MT1 fix round, I1). An earlier draft of this docblock also
 * called the first arm "the arm that re-fits a session opened from `.audm` or
 * from stem landing before any lane existed". It never did, and could not: those
 * paths committed a hardcoded 512 samples/px, which for anything longer than
 * about sixteen seconds is far zoomed IN of the fit, so `wasFitted` was false
 * and the arm was not taken. `measured` is module-global besides, so a SECOND
 * session opened in the same run finds the width unchanged and returns at the
 * guard without touching the zoom at all. Believing that sentence is what let
 * the reported bug survive the first pass: the load paths were left writing 512
 * because a rescue was assumed downstream. They now fit at the source (C1), and
 * this function is only what its two arms say.

 * that was legal when it was committed. The result is precisely the state the
 * single-clamp design exists to make unreachable: measured at 44x past the fit
 * after deleting one long clip, with the readout at 34% on a surface whose user
 * guide says it never drops below 100%.
 *
 * Worse than cosmetic, because `addClip`'s "was this view fitted?" arm is
 * `spp >= fit`: a stale over-the-ceiling zoom reads as FITTED, so the next
 * insert re-fits and throws away a zoom the user deliberately chose — the one
 * thing that arm promises not to do.
 *
 * ONE subscription rather than a call at the end of each mutation, because the
 * shortening paths are `removeClip`, `removeTrack`, `trimClip` and `moveClip`
 * PLUS undo/redo restore — and undo restores a snapshot without running any of
 * the four, so a per-action call would have missed it. Watching the length is
 * also the honest statement of the rule: it is the length that moves the
 * ceiling, whatever moved the length.
 *
 * Only SHRINKING re-resolves. Growth is `addClip`'s business and it has its own
 * deliberate policy (fit on the first clip, respect a chosen zoom after that);
 * re-resolving on growth here would be a second, competing opinion. And
 * re-resolving is not re-fitting: `applySessionZoom` re-clamps only what is now
 * out of range, so a zoom that still fits is left exactly where the user put it.

 * silence the user pointed at goes, and the arrangement around it does not.
 *
 * The same shape as `rippleDeleteClips` above — the shifts are resolved against
 * the timeline the user is looking at, before anything moves — but NOT through
 * the same door: the whole set is carried by ONE `translateClips` write instead
 * of one `moveClip` per clip. There is deliberately no removal step either — a
 * gap is empty by definition, so closing it is the ripple's second half alone.
 *
 * ONE WRITE, BECAUSE PER-CLIP MOVES INVENT CROSSFADES (final review, C3).
 * `moveClip` runs `maintainFacingFades` on every commit against a snapshot taken
 * at that commit, so two movers that OVERLAP EACH OTHER are pulled apart by the
 * first move and re-joined by the second — and the second move's snapshot, which
 * cannot see that the pair was overlapping before the gesture started, reads
 * width 0 and arms a full-width crossfade over a legitimate raw sum (or over the
 * user's own partial facing fade, which it overwrites; clip mutations have no
 * undo of their own). Translating the whole set by one delta preserves the
 * movers' relative geometry exactly, so no pair among them is ever "new"; the
 * only new adjacency the close creates is the butt-join at the gap's start,
 * width 0 — not an overlap, and nothing to arm.
 *
 * STALE GAPS ARE A NO-OP WITH NO GESTURE. The selection is reconciled on every
 * session change, but a caller can hold a `TrackGap` across one (the Edit menu
 * reads the store, the smoke hooks build their own), and closing a span that
 * is no longer empty would shift clips over a gap that is not there. Re-asking
 * `gapAt` through the same probe the reconcile uses is the check; a mismatch
 * moves nothing and pushes no entry.

// R3 — binds the session undo plumbing to this store (one-way dependency:
// this module imports sessionUndo, never the reverse). The snapshot is
// `{ session, selectedClipId }` — see SessionSnapshot in sessionUndo.ts for
// the ruling-3 view-state pin.
//
// MT1 (I7): `apply` used to re-derive the F9 clip-bitmap purge here by diffing
// clip ids across the snapshot swap, because an undo does not re-run the
// mutation that would otherwise have purged. That whole discipline went with
// `clipWaveformCache` — there is no per-clip bitmap to strand any more, since
// `ClipView` draws the visible band straight to its on-screen canvas.
//
// MT2 (fix round 1): the ONE entry in this app that changes what a session
// sample MEANS is an insert that made an empty session adopt the document's
// rate. Restoring its snapshot put the rate back and left the cursor, the
// playhead and the zoom counted in the ADOPTED rate — a cursor placed at
// 2.000 s in a 44.1 kHz session read 4.35 s after Ctrl+Z of a 96 kHz insert,
// and a 15-second window silently became a 32.7-second one.
//
// This is NOT ruling 3 being repealed, and the distinction is the reason the
// conversion lives HERE rather than in `SessionSnapshot`. Ruling 3 forbids
// restoring REMEMBERED view state: an undo must not yank the viewport back to
// where it was, because that buys no comprehension. Nothing is remembered here
// — the snapshot still carries only `{session, selectedClipId}`. The live
// cursor is kept exactly where the user left it and merely re-counted, which is
// what "the undo did not touch the cursor" MEANS once the ruler underneath it
// has been re-scaled. Same-rate restores — every other entry in the app — take
// the `ratio === 1` arm and write nothing but the session and the selection,
// so `sessionStore.undo.test.ts`'s ruling-3 pin holds unchanged.
//
// The I2 shrink-subscription above is NOT this: it re-resolves a zoom whose
// CEILING moved, which after a rate revert happens to catch the illegal cases
// but never the merely mis-denominated ones (a stale samples/px under the new
// fit is legal and still shows the wrong number of seconds).
