  /**
   * U2-3 — what happens when the user tries to leave a RUNNING pass, and why
   * it is a refusal rather than a background run that reattaches.
   *
   * The nicer answer would be to let the pass continue headless and have the
   * stepper pick it back up on return. It is not available, and the reason is
   * in the dialogs rather than in this file — but it is not one reason, it is
   * two, and an earlier draft of this comment claimed all nine shared the
   * first. They do not.
   *
   * SEVEN discard the result. They keep the pass in component state (`busy`,
   * `progress`, `liveResults`, `stageProgress`) paired with an unmount-cancel
   * ref — RemixDialog's `cancelledRef`, SeparateDialog's and TranscribeDialog's
   * `unmountedRef`, and the copies the two chains name after them. Those refs
   * do not merely silence a setState after unmount: each run body reads
   * `if (cancelledRef.current) return;` after its await and DISCARDS the
   * finished result. Unmounting one does not background it, it throws the pass
   * away — minutes of inference, silently.
   *
   * TWO used to do the opposite, and blocking was if anything more necessary
   * for them. `TempoDialog` guarded only a DOM ref, and `AlignTimingDialog` had
   * no unmount ref at all: their `applyTempoChange` / align calls resolved and
   * wrote to the store whichever way the UI went. Unmounting those mid-pass did
   * not lose the work — it ORPHANED it, committing an edit and an undo entry to
   * a document the user had walked away from, with no surface left that said it
   * happened.
   *
   * **T6-3 closed that, and the lock still stands.** Both now carry the cancel
   * ref the recorded follow-up asked for, read by `runEffectOnSelection` between
   * the audio arriving and `applyEdit` writing it, so a cancelled pass commits
   * nothing — no stretch, no marker correction, no beat grid — and says
   * `'cancelled'` rather than reporting the user's own walk-away as a no-op.
   * Every unmount-shaped exit is now genuinely safe: the strip, the ✕, another
   * pipeline tool, `focusSpatialPanel`.
   *
   * Relaxing the lock for these two was considered and REFUSED at the time,
   * because `moduleLock` was one flag driving four things and only three of
   * them were unmount-shaped. The fourth was the keyboard suspension, and the
   * hazard it guarded happened with the tool STILL MOUNTED — so no cancel ref
   * could see it. `Ctrl+O` mid-pass makes another document active; the pass
   * is pinned to its own `docId` and commits to the right audio, but
   * `applyEdit` writes the GLOBAL selection and cursor (`editOps.ts`), which
   * now belong to the document the user moved to.
   *
   * **Lot M (item 13 / M6) is the separation this comment predicted.**
   * `passLock.ts` — the app-wide single-pass lock — now owns the keyboard
   * question on its own terms: `dialogBus.hasOpenDialog()` narrows to the
   * MODAL stack only, and the four commands that could actually change which
   * document a pass is pinned to — `file.open`, `file.new`, `file.close`,
   * `session.open` — are disabled with a reason while the lock is held
   * (`menuActions.ts`, decisions.md's M-c), gating the hazard at the exact
   * seam it lives in instead of behind a blanket suspension. Everything else
   * — Space, Ctrl+Z, Home/End, the bare letters lot H added, the arrows —
   * reaches its command exactly as it would idle, because none of it can
   * touch which document the pass is pinned to.
   *
   * What "the app stays live" now means, in full. MOUSE interaction was
   * always untouched: the waveform, the transport, the toolbar, selection,
   * the playhead and the view segment all keep working, which is the point of
   * hosting. The KEYBOARD now stays live too, for the duration of a run —
   * only the pass-start doors and the four document-lifecycle commands above
   * grey out. `refuseWhileRunning` below is kept as App-level defence in
   * depth for the one caller left that bypasses the command registry
   * (`TranscriptPanel.tsx`'s "Transcribe again…" button reaches
   * `openTranscribeDialog` directly); every other door now reads its own
   * refusal off `isCommandEnabled`/`commandReason` before it ever calls in
   * here at all.

  // it), the lock must not outlive the render tree that was going to release
  // it. A stale hold here would wedge every OTHER window/session permanently,

  // released from inside its `stop()`, which nothing here calls
  // automatically on unmount otherwise — the view-switch effect above only

  // `isRecording()` guard, NOT the broader `stopAll()` fix round 2 first

  // `electron/main.cjs` never sets it. So the catastrophe this guard was
  // originally justified by is not currently reachable. It stays because the
  // insurance costs one condition and the failure mode it covers is total: if
  // that flag is ever flipped, or a future Electron changes its default back,
  // a near miss on a track lane would silently discard every open document.
  //
  // What it must NOT do is fire on anything else. The first version refused
  // EVERY drop, and the default action it was suppressing for text drags is
  // the one that inserts the text into a text control — which silently broke
  // dragging text into the lyrics, remix, voice-changer and properties fields.
  // Gating on `types` restores all of them: a text drag carries `text/plain`,
  // a clip drag carries our own MIME, and neither carries `Files`.
