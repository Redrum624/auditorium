/**
 * U2-3 — the mounting seam that lets a dialog render as a CARD instead of a
 * modal, without any dialog knowing about it.
 *
 * The user asked that selecting a pipeline "open the module in the extended
 * modules instead of a modal". Nine tools would have had to be rewritten to
 * obey that literally — nine bodies, nine sets of tests, and a head-on
 * collision with the concurrent rewrite of `CoverChainDialog`'s internals. But
 * none of the nine actually decides it is modal: each renders its body inside
 * `DialogShell`, and the SHELL is where the backdrop, the fixed overlay and the
 * open-dialog stack live. So the seam is one context read in one shared file,
 * and every dialog inherits the new presentation by being unchanged.
 *
 * The context carries exactly one thing in each direction:
 *
 * - Its PRESENCE is the instruction ("you are hosted"). A dialog rendered
 *   outside a provider is the modal it always was, byte for byte.
 * - `onModuleLockChange` is the report back up: "a pass is running that leaving
 *   this module would destroy". By default that is `!dismissable` — the flag
 *   every one of the nine already hands the shell to refuse Escape and a
 *   backdrop click mid-run — so nothing new had to be published, because the
 *   fact was already crossing this boundary.
 *
 * Why the report is the LOCK rather than `dismissable` itself. The two coincide
 * almost everywhere, but they are different questions: "may this dialog be
 * discarded" versus "must the app be held while it finishes". Auto-Remix starts
 * a tempo analysis in a mount effect, so it is born un-dismissable — and
 * equating the two greyed the whole module strip and suspended the keyboard the
 * instant the tool opened, for a pass the user had not started. A dialog can
 * now say so with `DialogShell`'s `moduleLock` prop; everything else keeps the
 * default and never learns this distinction exists.

   * unrecoverable local state the store cannot restore (typed text, a raw
   * recording) ever passes `hasUnsavedInput`, so every other hosted dialog
   * behaves exactly as before this was added. This is deliberately a
   * SEPARATE signal from `onModuleLockChange` — that one means "a pass is
   * running", this one means "closing me right now would silently destroy
   * something the user typed or recorded that no store holds" — conflating
   * them would have `App.tsx`'s drift watcher (the one consumer) either hold
   * the app-wide pass lock while the user is merely typing (wrong: M1 is
   * about passes, not text fields) or fail to protect a finished, idle
   * recording (wrong: `busy` is long since `false` by the time a take sits
   * waiting to be placed).
