/**
 * F7 — the Vocal Chain.
 *
 * The engine (`services/vocalChain.ts`) owns the order, the derivations and the
 * single undo entry. This dialog owns one job, and it is not "press go": it is
 * to make the pass ACCOUNTABLE, before and after.
 *
 * Before: every stage is listed in the order it will run, with the note that
 * says why it sits there and why it is on or off — and every stage is switchable
 * on its own. A stage the user cannot see or refuse is a stage that ran without
 * being seen.
 *
 * During: the same list, live. Every row carries a state — waiting, running,
 * ran, did not run, switched off — so the whole pass is legible top to bottom
 * while it happens; the running row is highlighted and says what it is doing
 * (measuring its settings, or rendering with the settings it just measured) and
 * how far through ITSELF it is. The bar at the foot is the whole pass, weighted
 * by the measured stage times, and that is the number it was always right for:
 * it cannot say which of thirteen stages the minute is being spent in.
 *
 * After: every stage says what it did. The settings it derived and what it
 * derived them FROM, the measured before/after RMS and peak, and how much of the
 * audio it left bit-identical. A stage that declined says so in amber with the
 * measurement that made it decline — never anything that could be mistaken for
 * having run. A stage that RAN but produced something the user has to know
 * about — the reverb's tail with the Limiter switched off, which lands over full
 * scale and is hard-clipped by both writers — carries its warning in the same
 * amber, above its measurements rather than instead of them.
 *
 * The two stages with `effectId === null` (Align Lyrics and Align Vocal Timing)
 * are listed without a checkbox: each needs the user to say WHICH thing to
 * change — which word, which syllables — so each is a separate dialog run
 * BEFORE this one, and offering a tick here would promise something the chain
 * cannot do.
 *
 * Nothing here grades the result. The numbers are stated; whether they are the
 * ones the user wanted is the user's call.
