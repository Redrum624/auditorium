 * Task S6 — the Separate into Stems dialog (plan ruling 8). Minimal by

 *
 * What it owes the user, in order of importance:
 *
 * 1. **Ruling 1's two guarantees, told apart.** The sum is a HARD guarantee
 *    (the Residual is the time-domain complement, so the five tracks are a
 *    partition of the source by construction); the separation QUALITY is
 *    model-bounded and is never promised. The dialog states both before the
 *    user commits minutes of inference, and when `landStems` reports
 *    `exactSumHolds === false` — an over-unity source, whose peak exceeds ±1
 *    so the multitrack master's clamp breaks the identity — it says THAT
 *    instead of repeating a promise that does not hold for the document in
 *    hand. `exactSumHolds === null` (the source was closed, the check could not
 *    be made) is rendered as no claim at all, per S5's contract.
 * 2. **The 166 MB download, stated before it starts.** The model is never
 *    bundled (ruling 3); the size, the one-time-ness and any failure are all
 *    plain text, and the failure leaves the button usable.
 * 3. **Every service refusal inline, in amber** (`text-[#e0a458]`, the app's
 *    convention) — never a `showMessageBox`, so the dialog stays open and the
 *    user can react. All nine `StemSeparationStatus` values render; the
 *    service's own messages are used verbatim, because they are already
 *    user-facing and duplicating them here would let the two drift.
 *
 * D5 — TWO commands, one dialog, and in voice mode a THREE-stage run:
 *
 *   1. `separateStems` — HT-Demucs, unchanged, Vocals + Backing in memory.
 *   2. `diarizeChannels(vocals)` — the segmentation + embedding host.
 *   3. the CONFIRMATION step, from which the user lands.
 *
 * `mode` picks the landing: `stems` (the five tracks, `edit.separateStems`) or
 * `voice` (the speaker split, `voice.separate`). Stems mode is untouched by
 * the speaker work — same title, same two sentences, same landing, same
 * auto-close — because nothing about it changed.
 *
 * Three things earn the confirmation step its place, and each is a thing that
 * cannot be undone cheaply once it has happened:
 *
 *   - A speaker COUNT is a guess. The auto policy is measured on four
 *     recordings (`SPEAKER_SEPARATION_LIMITS`) and the panel says so in the
 *     same breath as it offers the count for correction.
 *   - Landing N speakers builds N + 1 FULL-LENGTH documents — the N speakers
 *     and the Backing, 317.5 MB each for a 15-minute stereo source (D4) — so
 *     the panel prices the landing before it happens and refuses one that
 *     would not fit (`SPEAKER_LANDING_BUDGET_BYTES`).
 *   - Re-counting is free (`reclusterDiarization` over the kept evidence) but
 *     only until the run is thrown away. Landing first and re-counting after
 *     would cost a second five-minute model pass.
 *
 * Lifetime: `dismissable={!busy}` so neither Escape nor a backdrop click can
 * discard a running download or separation; the unmount cleanup CANCELS an
 * in-flight run — dispatched by the LIVE stage, because the two stages own two
 * different utility processes and killing the wrong one leaves a ~5 GB child
 * alive; and the target document is resolved from LIVE store state at confirm
 * time, never captured at open. An unmount during the REVIEW cancels nothing
 * (nothing is running) and lands nothing (the user never pressed Land).
