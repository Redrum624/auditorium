/**

 * file and `DialogShell`'s default (`dismissable = true`) takes over — that
 * tool reports "idle" for the whole of its pass, and one click on the strip
 * unmounts it and destroys the run, with every other test in this repo still
 * green. It is the most load-bearing token in the feature and it had no gate,
 * while the far less consequential width constant had one; this is the sibling.
 *
 * What it asserts, and why not the literal string. Requiring exactly
 * `dismissable={!busy}` would catch the three failures that matter — deletion,
 * hardcoding (`dismissable` / `{true}`), and inversion (`{busy}`) — but would
 * also fail on a harmless rename of the local flag, and `CoverChainDialog` is
 * being rewritten on another branch as this lands. So the assertion is the
 * SHAPE plus the wiring: the prop appears exactly once outside comments, its
 * value is the negation of a bare identifier, and that identifier is really
 * declared in the file (a `useState` binding, or a `const` derived from
 * several — both forms are in use across the ten). A literal, an inversion or
 * a deletion all fail; a rename passes and stays honest.
