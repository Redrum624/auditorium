/**
 * D6 — the Podcast Chain.
 *
 * The engine (`services/podcastChain.ts`) owns the order, the derivations, the
 * loudness measurement and the single undo entry. This dialog owns one job, and
 * it is not "press go": it is to make the pass ACCOUNTABLE, before and after.
 * It is the Vocal Chain dialog's shape deliberately — a user who has run one
 * should not have to learn the other — with three differences, all of them
 * forced by what this chain is:
 *
 * 1. EVERY stage has a checkbox. In the vocal and cover chains `effectId ===
 *    null` means "manual, never runs unattended" and those rows are listed
 *    without a switch. Here it means "the chain applies this one itself", and
 *    the only such stage is `loudness` — the stage most worth being able to
 *    switch off, since it is the one that moves the delivery level. Keying the
 *    checkbox off `effectId` (which a copy of the other dialog would) would
 *    make it the one stage the user cannot refuse.
 *
 * 2. The summary carries a LOUDNESS row. It is this chain's headline: the pass
 *    exists to land -16 LUFS in stereo or -19 in mono, and a report that showed
 *    RMS and peak but not the measurement the run was steered by would be
 *    hiding its own subject. `null` renders as `n/a` — 0.0 LUFS is full scale,
 *    not silence.
 *
 * 3. A REFUSAL is a first-class outcome. The chain will not run on a document
 *    with more than two channels, because its loudness measurement is
 *    standard-accurate for mono and stereo only. That path resolves a report
 *    with no stages and CALLS NO CALLBACK — `onProgress` never fires — so this
 *    dialog treats the promise resolving as completion rather than waiting on a
 *    bar that will never move, renders the engine's own sentence (which names
 *    the fix) and offers Close rather than an Apply that could only refuse
 *    again.
 *
 * The ceiling is a SAMPLE peak everywhere in this view, and the metric row says
 * so: the limiter is not oversampled, so no reading here is a true-peak one.
 *
 * Nothing here grades the result. The numbers are stated; whether they are the
 * ones the user wanted is the user's call.
