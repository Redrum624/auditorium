 * asks `coverPlacement.autoPlaces` — the same predicate the journey placed
 * from — rather than reading the report, so the sentence here and the clips on
 * the timeline cannot come apart.

 *    rows stop being "accept the guess" and become "that was the wrong one of
 *    these, use this instead", and the copy says where the take was put.
 *  - `'unrelated'` / unclassified: unchanged, and deliberately. The take is at
 *    zero and the offer is an OFFER — the reported case's 0.423 correlation and
 *    0.079 prominence sit inside the measured unrelated-pair bands, so placing
 *    it would be the app pretending to a confidence it just said it did not
 *    have.
 *
 * Either way the user acts in one press, with the measurement's own numbers in
 * front of them, and undoes it in one.
 *
 * The CC2 outcome fields are read through `coverPlacement`'s feature-detecting
 * helpers: on today's measurement shape (no `outcome`, no `candidates`) this
