/**
 * Shared editor pointer/wheel gestures for the waveform and spectrogram views:
 * plain/ctrl wheel zooms anchored on the EDIT CURSOR (D1 — it centred on the
 * mouse until then), shift-wheel scrolls; click sets the cursor, drag past 3px
 * makes a selection, shift-click extends, double-click selects the segment
 * under the pointer (item 8 / M3: the span between the two nearest markers; the
 * whole document when there are none). All state lives in the app store; the
 * only transient (the active drag) is a ref. Reuses the pure helpers in
 * selectionGestures/waveformRender/zoomAnchor so both views behave identically.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TASK B4 — THE MAGNET
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Cursor placement and the moving edge of a selection are quantised onto the
 * nearest beat or marker within {@link SNAP_TOLERANCE_PX} SCREEN pixels
 * (`snap.ts`). Three properties are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - **The anchor never moves.** Only the position the pointer is currently at
 *    is snapped. The selection anchor is snapped once, at pointerdown (the user
 *    pointed at it), and then used verbatim for the rest of the drag; a
 *    shift+click's anchor — an existing selection edge or the existing cursor —
 *    is never touched at all. "Snap must never move something the user did not
 *    drag."
 *  - **The zoom is passed in, never looked up globally** (trap 26). This hook
 *    uses the app store's `zoom.samplesPerPixel`; the multitrack passes its own
 *    `mtZoom`. A helper that reached for "the" zoom would quantise one surface
 *    at the other's scale.
 *  - **The modifier is re-read on EVERY pointer event** (trap: latching it at
 *    pointerdown breaks the escape hatch, and there is no key listener in the
 *    renderer to fall back on). Chromium puts the live modifier state on every
 *    pointer event, so `e.altKey` gives "suspended while held" — including
 *    pressing Alt in the middle of a drag and releasing it again — with no
 *    global listener to install, leak or race with pointer capture.
 *
 * **Alt was verified free in the BUILT app**, not assumed: the Electron default
 * menu is indeed still installed (`Menu.getApplicationMenu()` returns
 * File/Edit/View/Window — it was never disabled), but the window is frameless
 * (`electron/main.cjs`, `frame: false`), so there is no menu bar for Alt to
 * toggle: `win.isMenuBarVisible()` is false before and after, focus stays in
 * the document, and a `keydown`/`pointerdown` pair while Alt is held arrives in
 * the renderer with `altKey: true` and `defaultPrevented: false`.
 *
 * The target set is captured once, at pointerdown (`editorSnapTargets`), and
 * reused for the whole drag: it is a cached read, but it must also be STABLE —
 * an analysis completing mid-drag must not move the pointer under the user's
 * hand.
