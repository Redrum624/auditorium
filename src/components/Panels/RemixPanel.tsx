/**
 * The Auto-Remix adjustment surface (Task T15) for the ACTIVE document's remix
 * session — one row per join, plus the header-level Re-roll / Revert to auto /
 * crossfade controls.
 *
 * Deliberately a THIN surface over `remixService`: reject / lock / nudge /
 * re-roll / reset all live there, enforce their own invariants there, and are
 * the reason this panel exists at all. Nothing here re-derives a rule the
 * service already owns (the pin cap is the service's `MAX_LOCKED_JOINS`, the
 * "nothing to re-roll" test is the plan's own `canReroll`).
 *
 * Three wiring facts that are NOT cosmetic:
 *
 * 1. `useRemixVersion()` is called FIRST. The session store is module state
 *    behind `useSyncExternalStore`, not zustand, so without this subscription
 *    an adjustment would mutate the session and re-render nothing. There is
 *    also no allocating zustand selector below (each one returns a stable
 *    reference), which is the `MarkersPanel.tsx:12` `NO_MARKERS` lesson in its
 *    other form — an allocating snapshot is an infinite render loop.
 *
 * 2. Go To carries the `if (view === 'multitrack') setView('waveform')` guard
 *    (`MarkersPanel.tsx:72-85`). Cursor and zoom are the waveform/spectral
 *    editor's state; jumping while multitrack is on screen would be a silent
 *    no-op.
 *
 * 3. Staleness is a HARD gate. When the source document was edited or closed
 *    every adjustment in the service is already a no-op returning `null`;
 *    rather than let the user press dead controls, the banner explains it and
 *    every control — including Go To, per the task's own acceptance — is
 *    disabled. The remix audio itself is untouched and still plays.
 *
 * The row anatomy mirrors `MarkersPanel`: a plain container with SIBLING
 * controls, never a clickable row (a real double-click fires click, click,
 * dblclick, so a row-level handler fires twice before anything else can).
 *
 * UI scope: this ships as bare function. The v1.5 plan states the surface is
 * disposable and the service behind it is not; the layout gets its pass once
 * the three features land.

/**
 * The pin control's tooltip. A FUNCTION of BOTH the live pin count AND the
 * planner's own report on the arrangement currently on screen — never of one
 * alone, and never of a boolean reading of that report, which is three-valued
 * (`null` / `'enforced'` / `'preference'`). The phrase "strong preference"
 * appears in exactly the two states where the `remix-pins-not-guaranteed`
 * banner also appears, and the claim that every pin is enforced appears in
 * exactly the one state where the `remix-dropped-pins` note is absent. Those
 * are the invariants a property test asserts directly, over the whole
 * cross-product: banner, dropped-pins note and tooltip, one render, one answer.
 *
 * READING LESS THAN THE WHOLE REPORT WAS WRONG FIVE TIMES, each one state
 * further in:
 *
 * 1. (fix round 1, I1) A fixed "you already have more than 4 pins" was shown
 *    from `MAX_REQUIRED_JOINS` onward — it has to warn on the button that
 *    would become the fifth pin — so it was false at exactly 4, its commonest
 *    case.
 * 2. (fix round 2, I2) `toggleLockJoin` deliberately does not re-plan, so
 *    after pin 5 → Re-roll → unpin the live count is back inside the cap while
 *    the arrangement on screen is still a preference plan. A count-only
 *    tooltip then said "you have 4 pins, which is all the planner can
 *    guarantee" — implying those four ARE guaranteed — in the same render as a
 *    banner saying they are not.
 * 3. (fix round 2, found by the property test written for 2) The mirror image:
 *    triage means pins that are rejected or not a legal splice consume no
 *    guarantee slot, so SIX pins can be fully enforced. A count-only over-cap
 *    tooltip told those users their pins were "currently strong preferences"
 *    while the planner had enforced every one of them and the banner was
 *    correctly absent.
 * 4. (fix round 3) `mode === 'preference'` collapsed the report to a boolean,
 *    so `pinReport === null` — no plan has EVER been made with pins, because
 *    pinning does not re-plan — took the `else` branch and claimed the
 *    arrangement's pins were "all enforced" when the planner had never seen
 *    one of them.
 * 5. (fix round 3) "this arrangement's are all enforced" contradicted the
 *    `remix-dropped-pins` note ~100 px above it in the same header:
 *    `remixPlan.ts` keeps `mode: 'enforced'` while triage drops keys, and
 *    above the cap it MUST have dropped at least `count - MAX_REQUIRED_JOINS`
 *    of them — otherwise `feasible.length` would have exceeded the cap and the
 *    mode would be `'preference'`. So in that branch the "all enforced" claim
 *    was not merely sometimes wrong, it was never right.
 *
 * The lesson is in the shape rather than the strings: a fact the planner
 * decides must not be re-derived in the panel from a proxy, however obvious
 * the proxy looks — and a three-valued fact must not be read as two.
 *
 * `hasUnplannedPins` is the third input for the same reason: `satisfied` and
 * `dropped` together ARE the pin set the plan on screen was made with, so a
 * live pin in neither is one the planner has not seen, and nothing may be
 * claimed about its enforcement.
