 * Effects MENU's own tool tail — today `spatial.position` alone, drawn as a
 * 'Mix' section (`effectsMenuTools`). A tool row is a door to a command that
 * already exists: the id is handed to `runCommand`, the label is read off the
 * registry, and the greying is `isCommandEnabled` — the command's own
 * predicate. No behaviour is added here, and none can be: a row that looks
 * live but is stale still cannot fire, because `runCommand` re-checks
 * enablement before running.
 *
 * A PIPELINE-menu command appears in the Pipeline module only. F11-6 listed
 * the ten Pipeline tools here as a second door, and U2 kept them when the
 * Pipeline module arrived; item 5 of the 2026-08-18 program removed them at
 * the user's ruling ("if it is in Pipeline, remove it from Effects"). The Mix
 * row stays because it is not a Pipeline tool: T8 moved `spatial.position` to
 * the Effects MENU, the strip draws no icon for Spatial, and this row is the
 * positioner's only door outside that menu.
