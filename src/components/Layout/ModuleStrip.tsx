/**
 * U1 (layout E2): the G4 right-edge icon RAIL, rotated horizontal.
 *
 * The rail was a 58px-wide vertical column pinned to the window's right edge,
 * standing beside a 348px module column — 406px of chrome for eight icons and
 * one card. E2 folds the icons into a STRIP that sits on top of the module
 * column at the card's own width, so the two surfaces cost one width instead of
 * two and the waveform takes the whole difference. Nothing about what the
 * entries DO changed: same ids, same order, same lucide glyphs, the same
 * `sidebar-tabs` testid and the same accessible names the packaged smoke and
 * the G4 tests drive it by (grep `sidebar-tabs` in scripts/e2e-smoke.cjs).
 *
 * One behaviour is new, and E2 requires it: clicking the ACTIVE entry closes
 * the panel card. "With no card open the stage runs nearly the full window
 * width" is only reachable if the card can be closed at all, and the strip's
 * own entry is the only affordance that can close the thing it opened without
 * inventing a second control. `aria-pressed` already says which state a click
 * would leave, and the title spells the toggle out.

 * created." A strip entry is a claim that something is a MODULE — a place you
 * go and work — and a tool that answers one question is not that, however good
 * its panel is. Nothing about the panels changed; only who draws a door to

 * make both rules structural: `stripTabs` orders by slot rank, so a new entry
 * declares `'body'` and lands between the two ends no matter where in the array
 * it is written. `ModuleStrip.test` pins that there is exactly one `lead` and

 *   the permanents and U2 does not move it; History overtakes it.
