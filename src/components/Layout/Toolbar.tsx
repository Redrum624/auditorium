/**
 * v1.6 G3: the retired bottom TransportBar reborn as Vitrine's floating top
 * chrome pill (photo_app Layout/Toolbar.tsx anatomy). Since G6 the band truly
 * FLOATS over the radial stage (mockup `.toolbar` absolute placement — the
 * sidebars it used to avoid are floating overlays themselves now): an absolute
 * z-20 band whose empty stretches ignore pointer events so the stage beneath
 * stays live.
 *
 *   [Open | Save Export | ⏮ ⏹ ▶ ⏺ ⟳ | views | − % + Fit]        [module strip]
 *
 * U1 (layout E2): the top-left file chip is GONE. Its identity readout —
 * name · duration · rate · channels — folded into the bottom bar, where the
 * eye already goes for time and levels, and its zoom % died with it: the same
 * number is live two controls away in this pill's own − % + group, so the
 * chip was spending a whole floating surface on a duplicate. The band now
 * centres the pill on the waveform instead of the window (see the wrapper).
 *
 * Every control keeps its command id, aria-label, enabled-state and testid
 * from the bottom bar (plan ruling 4). This component also inherits, verbatim,
 * the TransportBar's store↔engine wiring: it owns loading the active document
 * into the PlaybackEngine, mirroring each engine's state, and pumping its play
 * position (routed by the active view) so the waveform playhead and the
 * multitrack playhead both track their engine. The big time readout moved to
 * the bottom status pill (StatusBar) and the level meter moved with it.
