/**
 * MT1-2 — WHERE THE 4096-PX RASTER CAP WENT.
 *
 * v1.5.2 added `MAX_CLIP_WAVEFORM_DEVICE_PX = 4096`: the waveform raster (both
 * the on-screen backing store and the cached offscreen bitmap) had been sized
 * to the clip's FULL timeline pixel width — ~7.6 MB per clip at default zoom,
 * ~30 MB at 4x, LRU-retained 200 deep — so it was capped at 4096 device px and
 * blit-STRETCHED across the clip's CSS width.
 *
 * That fixed the memory and broke the picture. A three-minute clip is tens of
 * thousands of CSS px wide at any working zoom, so the ~1–2 kpx actually on
 * screen were being magnified out of a few hundred of those 4096 columns: a
 * coarse solid blob where the editor showed detail, and a thin sparse line
 * wherever the magnified columns happened to fall between transients. That is
 * the visual-quality complaint MT1-2 exists to answer.
 *
 * The cap is DELETED rather than raised, and deliberately not replaced by a
 * bigger one, because the fix removes the thing it was protecting against: the
 * raster now covers only the on-screen band (`ticWindow`, at most the viewport
 * plus two 256-px quanta) instead of the whole clip, so it is bounded by the
 * WINDOW rather than by the content. A cap on top of a viewport-bounded raster
 * would be a second bound on an already-bounded number, i.e. dead code that
 * reads like a live safeguard.
 *
 * Stated in the right units, because an earlier draft of this paragraph claimed
 * "strictly smaller than the 4096-px cap at every zoom" and that is FALSE: it
 * compared a CSS-pixel band against a DEVICE-pixel cap. The band is ~2.5 k CSS
 * px on a 2 k-wide window, and the backing store is `(band) · dpr` — 4864 device
 * px at dpr 2, which is LARGER than 4096. The real win is not a smaller single
 * raster; it is that the raster no longer scales with clip length (a 3-minute
 * clip cost ~7.6 MB at default zoom and ~30 MB at 4x) and that the LRU-200
 * cache retaining up to two hundred of them is gone entirely. Peak memory falls
 * by orders of magnitude; the per-clip raster is merely bounded instead of
 * unbounded.
 *
 * The one thing that must never come back is the full-clip-width canvas: clips
 * are never viewport-culled, so a clip-width raster is unbounded by
 * construction (and past the browser's maximum canvas dimension on a long clip,
 * where it silently goes blank). Both bands here are viewport-derived, which is
 * the invariant `ClipView.test.tsx` and `ClipView.beatTics.test.tsx` pin.

  // "what a waveform looks like" lives in this file any more, so the two
  // surfaces cannot drift (they had already: one flat fill pass, no trace, no
  // axis, a hardcoded `rgba(38,198,218,0.85)` instead of `--accent`).
  //
  // WHAT MAKES IT SHARP. The raster covers only `band` — the on-screen slice —
  // at one column per CSS pixel times dpr, and is drawn at the CURRENT zoom.
  // The old path rasterised the clip's WHOLE timeline width into at most 4096
  // columns and blit-stretched that over the clip's CSS width, so the visible
  // part came from a few hundred magnified columns (see the note where the cap
  // used to live). Stretching is what cost the detail; not stretching is the
  // whole fix. This is also less memory than the cap it replaces, not more.
  //
  // WHY THERE IS NO OFFSCREEN CACHE ANY MORE. `clipWaveformCache` bucketed zoom
  // by `floor(log2(spp))` precisely so one bitmap could be blit-scaled across a
  // 2x zoom range — the trick that produced the blur. A resolution-correct
  // raster cannot be reused across zooms by definition, and it does not need to
  // be reused across scrolls either: the deps below are the QUANTISED band, so
  // React already skips the repaint until the band actually moves (once per
  // 256 px of travel), and the genuinely expensive part — building the peak
  // pyramid — is still cached, by `peaksCache`, per document. Measured on a
  // 3-minute source: `buildPeaks` 22 ms (cached, untouched here) versus 1.2 ms
  // for a 2432-column band from that pyramid — cheaper than the 1.95 ms
  // full-clip 4096-column raster the cache existed to avoid recomputing. A
