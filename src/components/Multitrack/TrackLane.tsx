/** The timeline lane for one track: a relatively-positioned strip holding its
 * clips (absolutely positioned by sample→pixel). Clicking empty lane space
 * clears the selection — the clips always, and a standing gap band unless the
 * press is inside that band's own span (D3); DOUBLE-clicking empty lane space
 * selects the gap it landed in. `isDragTarget` highlights the lane a clip is
 * being dragged onto — by a clip's own pointer drag, or (F11-4) by an HTML5 drag
 * carrying a Files-panel row or a file from Explorer.
 *
 * V1 — WHY THIS ELEMENT IS `overflow-clip`, AND WHY IT HAS TO BE THIS ONE.
 * A clip's `left` is `(startSample − scrollSample) / spp`, so every clip whose
 * start has been scrolled past has a NEGATIVE left: its box legitimately
 * extends thousands of px to the left of the lane's origin, and its waveform
 * raster starts up to 255 px left of that origin as well, because the band is
 * quantised OUT to 256 px so a scroll within a quantum costs no re-raster
 * (`ticWindow`). The header column is 224 px — narrower than that worst case —
 * and it is a STATIC flex sibling, so a positioned clip paints over it, name,
 * M/S/R/X and all (the reported defect, seen at 381 % zoom).
 *
 * This lane is the only element that can bound it. `.glass-track-row`'s own
 * `overflow: hidden` clips at the ROW box, which contains the header, so it
 * arrives 224 px too late; clamping `band.start` to the lane origin would fix
 * the raster (and only the raster — not the clip's own fill, border, fade
 * overlay or label) at the cost of the quantum, i.e. a re-raster per scrolled
 * pixel. Clipping here bounds every clip child at once, and it works precisely
 * because this element is `relative`: an absolutely-positioned descendant is
 * only clipped by an ancestor that is its containing block. The two classes are
 * one mechanism — `TrackLane.clipping.test.tsx` pins both.
 *
 * `clip`, NOT `hidden`. Both clip painting and hit-testing identically, but
 * `hidden` also makes the lane a SCROLL CONTAINER, and a clip really does
 * extend millions of px past the lane's right edge at a working zoom, so there
 * would be genuine scrollable overflow to scroll. Nothing here ever resets
 * `scrollLeft`, and every pointer→sample mapping in this subtree reads the
 * border-box left with no `scrollLeft` term (`laneRawStart` below,
 * `pixelToSample(clientX − rectLeft, …)` in `EnvelopeLane`): one stray
 * `scrollIntoView`, or the first focusable control anyone adds to a lane, would
 * leave clips painted shifted by −`scrollLeft` while drops, envelope keys and
 * the drag ghost landed at the unshifted sample. `overflow: clip` cannot be
 * scrolled at all, so that is ruled out by the CSS instead of by an invariant
 * nothing enforces. (Chromium 90+; the app ships on Electron.)
 *
 * The two drag mechanisms stay strictly apart: a clip move is a POINTER
 * gesture with capture (it must track a pointer that has left the element),
 * while a drop from outside the window can only be an HTML5 drag, because the
 * OS gives a page nothing else. They meet only at `snapClipStart` — the same
 * magnet, the same clamp — and at `isDragTarget`, the same highlight. */

          exactly the edge where a user most needs to see the snap take hold.
          Clamping the LINE is honest rather than a white lie: a clip landing at
          that sample is itself drawn with a negative left and clipped by the
