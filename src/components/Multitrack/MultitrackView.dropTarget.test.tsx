/**
 * V1 review, Minor 3 — WHICH TRACK A DROP LANDS ON WHEN THE POINTER IS OVER A
 * TRACK HEADER.
 *
 * V1 clipped the lane, which fixed the reported defect (a scrolled clip painting
 * across the header) and quietly changed this: before it, a pointer over another
 * track's header hit that lane's OVERHANGING clip box, so `resolveTrackAt`
 * answered with that track; after it, the pointer hits the static header, and
 * `closest('[data-track-id]')` — an attribute only the lane carried — found
 * nothing, so `?? trackId` kept the clip on the track it came from.
 *
 * THE DECISION (T1): the track under the pointer wins, header included. A row is
 * one track, and this app draws the header INSIDE the row rather than in a
 * separate panel, so a pointer over track 3's header is a pointer over track 3 —
 * the same answer Audition gives for the timeline. The row carries the
 * `data-track-id` now, so one resolver answers for the whole row.
 *
 * The alternative considered and rejected was to REJECT a drop over a foreign
 * header (commit nothing). That was conditioned on cross-track move being out of
 * scope, and it is not: a SINGLE-clip drag has committed to the lane under the
 * pointer since the ORIGINAL multitrack commit, `0360219`. `git log -S` puts
 * `resolveTrackAt` and `onDragOverTrack` in that commit, and `git log -S` over
 * the `ClipView` docblock line that describes the behaviour — "move
 * horizontally (live transform) and across tracks (target lane highlighted),
 * committed on release" (`ClipView.tsx:179-181`) — returns that same single
 * commit, so the sentence has stood unedited since the feature landed. (An
 * earlier version of this docblock dated it "since X4". Wrong: X4 edited those
 * call sites, it did not introduce them. The behaviour is older than stated,
 * not younger.) Rejecting would also need a visual language the surface does
 * not have — a gesture that does nothing, with no target highlighted to explain
 * it — whereas routing makes the highlight and the commit agree, because both
 * read this one resolver. The GROUP branch never consults it (K1 v1 moves every
 * member on its own track, the documented limitation), so nothing here widens
 * what a group drag does.
 *
 * The last arm is the one this must not break: a pointer over NOTHING — the
 * ruler, the gap below the last row, outside the window — still commits on the
 * source track. That is what makes a purely horizontal drag survive a pointer
 * that strays vertically, and it is the behaviour the preview showed.
