 * action is public, with callers in the E2E hooks and in a rollback restore,
 * and it used to store whatever it was handed. Everything downstream then
 * inherited the inversion and split three ways on it: the audio primitives
 * THREW (`clampRange`'s `RangeError`, which reached the user through Copy,
 * Silence and every effect), a few readers guarded and degraded, and most
 * assumed. `editOps.ts` recorded the case as deferred to "this family's next
 * round"; this is that round.
 *
 * Ordered HERE, at the write, rather than at a read helper, because the readers
 * that most need it are the ones a helper cannot reach: the status bar's
 * duration, the properties panel, the transport's play-from and loop region,
 * the playback engine's loop bounds, three dialogs' region readouts. Those
 * describe the selection rather than resolve it against a document, and they
 * need no document to be right. This codebase's own precedent for the shape is
 * `applyEditorZoom` — "the ONE clamping writer", introduced after six surfaces
 * were found writing zoom raw.
 *
 * Only the ORDER is fixed here. The extent is clamped into `[0, docLength]` by
 * `selectionRegion.ts`, at the read, because that is where the document is
 * known — two invariants, each placed where its inputs are.
 *
 * An ordered pair is returned by IDENTITY, so an unchanged write is not a new

 *    they carry on compressing toward the left edge.

 * lines and the timeline even though the track has reached its limit". Making
 * the ceiling the fit makes the incoherent range unreachable, and gives Fit,
